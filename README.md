# FemDevs Homepage

This is the codebase for the official FemDevs homepage. It is built in Node.js using the Express framework.
Frontend code is written in Pug.js and TailwindCSS.

For information on exactly what is used, please see the [List of Tools](#list-of-tools) section below.

## How To Run

First, you need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://npmjs.com).

To install Node, either download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/), or run one of the following
commands depending on your operating system:

### Windows

```powershell
# Install Git
winget install --id Git.Git -e --source winget

# Install Node.js
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force;
[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072;
iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'));
choco install nodejs
```

### MacOS

```bash
# you can download Homebrew from https://brew.sh/
brew install node npm git
```

### Linux

```bash
# Ubuntu
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install nodejs npm git -y
# Fedora / Red Hat
sudo dnf install nodejs npm git -y
# Arch
sudo pacman -Sy nodejs npm git
# openSUSE
sudo zypper install nodejs npm git -y
# CentOS
sudo yum install nodejs npm git -y
```

Then clone the repository and run the following commands:

```bash
# cloning the repository
git clone "https://github.com/femdevs/femdev-website"
cd femdevs-website
# installing dependencies
npm install
npm run build
```

Make sure to define the following environment variables in a `.env` file:

```env
HOST=''
USER=''
PASSWORD=''
DATABASE=''
DISCORD_TOKEN=''
DISCORD_WEBHOOK=''
FIREBASE_SA=''
CRYPT_PRIV=''
IPINFO_AT=''
AUTH_PROJECT_ID=''
AUTH_API_SECRET=''
VERIPHONE_TOKEN=''
OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY=''
DAK=''
TAK=''
GMAPS_API_KEY=''
NODE_ENV=''
GH_TOKEN=''
STRIPE=''
STRIPE_WH_SECRET=''
C_IV=''
C_KEY=''
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=''
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=''
DISCORD_REDIRECT_URI=''
LOCALHOST_PAGE=''
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=''
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=''
SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=''
SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN=''
SPOTIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN=''
FIREBASE_API_KEY=''
FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=''
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=''
FIREBASE_APP_ID=''
FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=''
```

Then, launch the development server with the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The Webpage will be available at `http://localhost:3000`. (Note; CDNs, assets, and APIs are automatically setup to pull from the official server (`XXX.thefemdevs.com`), and therefore will not work regularly on localhost. You will need to make additional modifications to the code to be able to access said resources locally, such as setting the `LOCALHOST_PAGE` environment variable.)
